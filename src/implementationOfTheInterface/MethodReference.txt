1. it is used for the implementation of the Functional interface
2.it uses the lamba expressions internally for implementation of the functional interface
3.it internally creates the four types of lambda expressions
4. its is the easy way to implementation for the functional interface
5. it uses the already exsisted method for the implementation of the functional interface
6.the signature of the method should be same as the abstract method
in the functional interface
7. "::"--> method refernce operator used for the creating the
lamda functions internally already method logic is assigned to the
